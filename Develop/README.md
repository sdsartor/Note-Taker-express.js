## Requirements
This application requires you to have a smart device capable of using the internet and in order to reproduce the application code, you will need node.js, express.js, npm i, and middleware in order to establish a good note taking application and a server for the application to deploy.


## Description
This application is great for people that want to make notes that they can store for later.  On top of that, you can delete the notes after they are created if you so desire.  Any body that has a link to the note taker can use it and it is open to use by people other than just coders.


## Installation
This application requires the assistance of heroku to deploy the application, node.js to install npm, express.js to work in the backend of code, and a decent understanding of databases and routes to deploy and ensure that the right code goes to the right routes.  To start the code, make sure that both html templates are directed to the same index route and that the api route is set to add notes to the json of the database folder.


## Usage
This application is great for saving information quickly and access it easily.  On top of this, it can also add new notes and remove unwanted notes thanks to the trash can icon found on each and every created note.
